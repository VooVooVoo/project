Unfortunately, I'm too exhausted to present the whole idea
- this is just a stub of the thing.

I'm planning to build a <b>text-based rpg</b> with different locations, stories,<br>
enabling the player to interact with the environment by means of choosing<br>
appropriate actions from the pool of all possible actions but also to roam freely <br>
using arrow keys. We'll how it goes.
